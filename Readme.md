# Mandelbrot Set Graphing Program

This program creates a graph of the Mandelbrot set with the ability to adjust parameters and zoom in and out.

The purpose of the project was to learn more about graphical user interfaces and how to create and manipulate images using pixel arrays.

The program has 3 files: one to create and update the GUI, one to create the graph's image, and one to handle arithmetic for complex numbers.

The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of numbers in the complex plane which do not diverge when a function is iteratively applied. For more information, visit this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set.
